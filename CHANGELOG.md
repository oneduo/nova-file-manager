This release comes packed with new features, improvements and fixes.

### 🍍 Pinia

The package moved to Pinia, a store and state management library set to become the new default for Vue projects. Since this project is still pretty young, we aim to ensure a long support of the libraries and tools we use. Pinia keeps the same paradigm as Vuex, and does provides many enhancements and improvements to the existing Vuex library.

### 📖 Folder upload support

You want to upload a folder and all of its content ? We got you covered ! Just drag and drop your folders and we will handle the rest.

### 🔍 Spotlight search

Where's my car dude ?

With this new release, we introduce a new spotlight-like search feature, it will allow quick access to your folders and files.

![spotlight-dark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81156495/192477149-c24a3618-a34b-4005-a364-da89ce633d28.png)

### 🧭 Onboarding tour

Want to give your users a guided tour of the file manager ? We got you !
You can now enable a quick and short tour of the tool to guide your users.

### 💼 Unzip archives

What is that ? A zip archive ? Arrrrghh

We used to say that before, but zip files do not scare us anymore, you can unzip and put your content outside the archive right from the file manager. Easy, quick, simple.

### ✨ PDF Viewer

Do you even PDF ?

Just slap a PDF embed viewer in the tool, this way it is more convenient and could spare you linking the wrong files to the wrong person.

### 💄 Pintura Image Editor

![pintura-light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81156495/192477190-f558f6a7-9756-4ab4-b362-78d120761a21.png)

Looking for a fully featured image editor ? We got you covered. We are pleased to announce we have added a new integration for Pintura, an image editor by [Rik Schennink](https://github.com/rikschennink)

Please note that Pintura is a paid library and is not included in Nova File Manager.

You need to acquire a license and then follow the steps in the documentation to set up your integration.

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE - VENDOR NAME CHANGE

With this new release, we have moved to a new vendor, we have updated our repo and the packagist registry for our package. This change should not introduce any unwanted behavior, however, if you encounter any issues you may need to run **one (or all) of the following commands** :

```bash
rm -rf vendor/




























```
```bash
composer install oneduo/nova-file-manager




























```
```bash
composer rm bbs-lab/nova-file-manager




























```
> **Note**
In case you're experiencing trouble setting up the package with the new vendor, please open a new issue and we will look into it.

## 0.5.0 - 2022-09-08

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE

> **Warning**

Existing assets saved with the field will not work anymore once you update the tool, please migrate your existing data when updating the package.

This PR introduces a major breaking changing related to how the data is saved in the database, initially we tried to follow Laravel Nova's built-in fields as much as possible by having a two column set up to save the asset's path and then the asset's disk if needed. However, this approach isn't as reliable as we hoped for it to be. There was indeed a particular use case that wasn't in our scope when building the field, when saving multiple assets from different disks, only the one disk was to be saved in the disk column and that makes the tool behaves in unintended ways.

We have moved forward with a JSON schema to save the field's data.

Starting from the next 0.5 release, the data will change from :

| image                | image_disk    |
|----------------------|---------------|
| `<image-path-value>` | `<disk-name>` |

TO

| image                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{"path": "<image-path-value>",   "disk": "<disk-name>" } ` |

So in other words, each asset that will saved with its corresponding disk.

We regret to introduce such a change so early, but it is a change that needs to be done unfortunately.

To migrate your existing data, you may defined a command or action to transform your data to the required schema.
